# Wearable Data Analysis

This repository contains examples of data analysis for wearables. In particular we examine analysis of accelerometer data for gait analysis using [Scikit Digital Health (SKDH)](https://github.com/pfizer-opensource/scikit-digital-health) and heart rate analysis from ECG data using [HeartPy](https://python-heart-rate-analysis-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).


## Requirements
1. [Scikit Digital Health (SKDH)](https://github.com/pfizer-opensource/scikit-digital-health)
1. [HeartPy](https://python-heart-rate-analysis-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
1. Jupyter notebook
